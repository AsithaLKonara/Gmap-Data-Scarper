## Tips

- **Performance**: Large CSV files (>10K rows) may load slowly. Consider filtering first.
- **Search**: Use the search box to quickly find specific leads by name or URL
- **Export**: Always export filtered results to preserve your analysis
- **Refresh**: The dashboard auto-refreshes when you change filters

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard won't start

```bash
# Check if Streamlit is installed
pip install streamlit pandas

# Try running directly
python -m streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

### CSV file not loading

- Check file path is correct
- Ensure CSV file exists
- Try uploading file directly instead of using path
- Check CSV file is valid (not corrupted)

### Charts not showing

- Ensure CSV has required columns (Platform, business_type, etc.)
- Check if filters are too restrictive (no data matches)
- Verify data is not all "N/A"

### Performance issues

- Use filters to reduce dataset size
- Consider splitting large CSV files
- Close other applications to free up memory

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Port

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Custom Theme

Create `.streamlit/config.toml`:

```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#1f77b4"
backgroundColor = "#ffffff"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#f0f2f6"
textColor = "#262730"
font = "sans serif"
```

## Integration

The dashboard works with CSV files generated by the scraper. It automatically detects v2.0+ fields and provides appropriate visualizations.

For programmatic access, use the enrichment API:

```python
from enrichment.enrich_existing import enrich_existing_csv

enrich_existing_csv("input.csv", "output_enriched.csv")
```

Then load the enriched CSV in the dashboard for visualization.

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced statistical analysis
- Export to Excel/JSON
- Custom chart types
- Dashboard themes
- User authentication (for production)
