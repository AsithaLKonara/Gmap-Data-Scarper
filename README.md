## SSO/SAML Support

- SSO/SAML login is only available in Docker or supported Linux environments.
- On macOS 12, the SSO endpoints are placeholders and will not function.
- For SSO development, use Docker or deploy to a Linux server.

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture

LeadTap supports full multi-tenancy for SaaS and enterprise use cases. All user, job, lead, CRM, analytics, notification, support, and API key data is isolated by tenant (organization).

### How it works
- Each user, job, lead, etc. is associated with a `tenant_id`.
- All API requests must include the `X-Tenant` header (tenant slug), set automatically by the frontend after login/registration.
- Backend endpoints strictly filter and validate by tenant, preventing cross-tenant data access.
- Super-admins can manage tenants, onboard new organizations, and switch context for support.

### Migration for Existing Data
- Run `python scripts/assign_default_tenant.py` to assign all orphaned records to a Default Tenant.

### Tenant Onboarding
- Use the admin endpoints to create a new tenant (organization).
- Invite users to the tenant via the onboarding API or UI.
- Users must enter their organization/tenant slug on login/registration.

### Security
- All endpoints enforce tenant isolation.
- Automated tests and utilities ensure no cross-tenant data leaks.
